# PokeAPIGame
This game was developed in the context of learning Java during Mindera School.
As a requirement we had to use PokeAPI.
As the learning progressed, the project became a Maven project with some associated SQL.
I took the opportunity to learn new features such as adding colors to the Terminal, accessing the Database and making the necessary requests.
I really enjoyed doing this project, as I was able to apply some prior knowledge and improve my own programming.
